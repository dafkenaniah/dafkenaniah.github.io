Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior QA Manager, Gameplay position on the Teamfight Tactics team at Riot Games. As QA Lead for Global AI and Automation Strategy at Sony Interactive Entertainment, I have led QA teams for live service games with complex gameplay systems, managing everything from patch testing to live ops support across multiple titles with millions of active users. I am ready to bring that same expertise and passion to help TFT deliver the smooth, balanced, and engaging gameplay that players expect from Riot.

What I will bring to TFT:

• Live service gameplay QA expertise with systematic testing of core mechanics, balance changes, champion abilities, and meta-shifting updates, implementing parallel execution strategies (5 kits simultaneously) that achieve 33.48% coverage expansion for comprehensive gameplay validation

• Advanced testing methodologies including AI-enhanced analysis for pattern recognition in gameplay data, predictive defect modeling that identifies balance issues before they impact players, and systematic automation frameworks achieving 179.55% efficiency improvements

• Comprehensive test strategy and planning covering gameplay systems, progression mechanics, economy balance, matchmaking algorithms, and social features, with AI-generated risk assessment matrices and 75% forecast confidence for release planning

• Cross-functional collaboration excellence with game design and engineering teams, implementing automated Slack bridges for real-time bug communication, comprehensive Jira databases for precise defect reproduction, and unified global metrics that align gameplay quality with player experience

• Team leadership and systematic mentorship having scaled automation adoption from 7 to 47+ users, established standardized testing processes across international studios, and created quality ownership culture where systematic excellence drives results

Recent live service achievements at Sony Interactive Entertainment:

• Led Global AI and Automation Strategy for multiple live service titles managing comprehensive patch cycles, seasonal content validation, and live ops support with systematic KPI tracking and centralized database storage for data-driven gameplay decisions

• Built revolutionary automation frameworks including FORGE (advanced gameplay testing), Pathfinder integration (rapid iteration validation), and AI-powered regression suites that eliminated thousands of hours of manual effort while improving critical bug detection

• Established comprehensive testing protocols including smoke, regression, and exploratory gameplay validation that caught meta-breaking issues early, enabled faster iteration cycles, and maintained competitive balance across aggressive update schedules

• Developed AI-enhanced reporting systems providing real-time build health visibility, gameplay balance trend analysis, and predictive risk assessment for complex gameplay interactions and competitive meta stability

• Implemented systematic collaboration frameworks with designers and engineers for precise gameplay bug reproduction, balance issue verification, performance regression detection, and comprehensive player experience optimization

My technical expertise includes comprehensive experience with live service workflows, patch cycle management, gameplay automation frameworks, Python scripting for balance validation, advanced Git workflows, systematic CI/CD deployment, and proven expertise across PC and mobile platforms with complex multiplayer systems.

I am deeply passionate about competitive gaming balance and understand the critical importance of maintaining gameplay integrity in live service environments. My systematic approach to gameplay validation combined with AI-enhanced analysis capabilities positions me to immediately contribute to TFT's continued evolution and competitive excellence.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to help TFT continue delivering the polished, engaging gameplay that Riot is known for while maintaining the competitive balance that keeps millions of players engaged.

Sincerely,
