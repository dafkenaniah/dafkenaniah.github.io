Hiring Manager
Agtonomy
South San Francisco, CA

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the QA Manager position at Agtonomy. As QA Lead for Global AI and Automation Strategy at Sony Interactive Entertainment, I have built comprehensive QA programs for complex software systems with AI/ML components, established testing standards for safety-critical applications, and led teams that ensure product reliability across mission-critical environments. I am eager to apply that expertise to autonomous agricultural technology where quality and safety are paramount.

What I will bring to Agtonomy:

• AI/ML system testing expertise having established quality processes for AI-driven automation analysis, implementing systematic KPI tracking and centralized database storage that enables predictive analytics, intelligent maintenance scheduling, and dynamic ROI optimization

• Safety and reliability focus from managing products with millions of active users where defects have significant impact, including comprehensive risk-based testing approaches, systematic failure mode analysis, and 20% stability improvement achievements (reducing active issues from 42 to 30)

• Advanced automation and continuous testing capabilities having built FORGE framework implementations, Pathfinder integration systems, and CI/CD pipelines that achieve 179.55% efficiency improvements while maintaining stringent quality standards

• Cross-functional collaboration excellence with engineering, product, and operations teams, implementing automated Slack bridges for real-time communication, comprehensive Jira databases, and unified global metrics frameworks that ensure quality is integrated into product design

• Team leadership and process establishment expertise having scaled QA operations from 7 to 47+ automation users across international studios, establishing standardized processes and mentoring teams on advanced testing methodologies

Recent achievements at Sony Interactive Entertainment:

• Led Global AI and Automation Strategy QA initiatives managing quality across complex systems with AI/ML components, establishing testing standards that ensure reliability, safety, and performance across multiple product lines

• Built comprehensive test automation frameworks achieving 63.64% efficiency gains and systematic parallel execution capabilities (5 kits simultaneously) with 33.48% coverage expansion for enhanced validation depth

• Established AI-ready data infrastructure enabling predictive automation analytics, machine learning-enhanced defect prediction, and intelligent resource allocation that prevents costly system failures

• Developed executive reporting systems providing 75% forecast confidence, real-time quality metrics, and comprehensive risk assessment matrices that support data-driven decision making for complex systems

• Implemented quality validation strategies achieving documented time savings across multiple projects, systematic resource optimization, and expanded testing capabilities through revolutionary automation deployment

My technical expertise includes comprehensive experience with Python automation, AI/ML system testing, FORGE framework, advanced CI/CD systems, systematic regression testing, and proven expertise across complex distributed systems. I excel in environments where precision, reliability, and safety-critical validation drive excellence.

While my background is in gaming, the core QA competencies I have developed—AI system testing, automation expertise, safety-critical validation, systematic risk assessment, and cross-functional collaboration—translate directly to autonomous systems where reliability and safety are mission-critical. I am eager to learn about agricultural robotics and apply my proven quality expertise to help Agtonomy deliver safe, reliable autonomous solutions.

Thank you for considering my application. I would love to discuss how I can help Agtonomy build world-class QA capabilities for autonomous agriculture that ensure both innovation and safety excellence.

Sincerely,
Kenneth Davis
