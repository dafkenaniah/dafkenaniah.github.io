My technical toolkit includes extensive experience with Python scripting, Selenium automation, FORGE framework, Pathfinder integration, Git workflows, advanced CI/CD systems, and proven expertise across web, mobile, and backend testing environments. I excel in fast-paced, startup environments where quality standards are evolving and where I can make immediate, measurable impact.

I am particularly excited about Mandolin's innovative approach and the opportunity to build world-class QA capabilities that scale with rapid growth. My proven track record of establishing QA processes from the ground up, combined with AI-enhanced analysis capabilities, positions me to immediately contribute to Mandolin's success.
