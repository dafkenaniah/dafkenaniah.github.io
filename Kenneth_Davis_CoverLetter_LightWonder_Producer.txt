• Daily communication and milestone tracking systems including AI-enhanced executive dashboards, real-time quality metrics, and predictive risk analysis that provide stakeholders comprehensive visibility into project health and development patterns

• Cross-functional collaboration excellence having bridged Test Services and Engineering across time zones, implementing automated Slack bridges for real-time communication, and establishing unified global metrics frameworks that align creative and technical goals

• Testing and release process leadership with systematic parallel execution capabilities (5 kits simultaneously), 33.48% coverage expansion achievements, and comprehensive validation protocols that ensure every product meets quality standards

• Regulatory and compliance expertise from managing games with strict platform certification requirements across PS5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms, including international market compliance coordination

Recent production achievements at Sony Interactive Entertainment:

• Led Global AI and Automation Strategy production coordination managing quality across multiple titles with millions of active users, implementing systematic KPI tracking and centralized database storage for data-driven project decisions

• Established comprehensive project tracking with FORGE framework implementation reducing development time, Pathfinder integration for rapid prototyping, and Visual Studio/DART environments standardized across global studios

• Built AI-ready data infrastructure providing predictive analytics for project timeline forecasting, intelligent resource scheduling, and dynamic ROI optimization that creates competitive advantage through systematic data collection

• Developed executive reporting systems delivering 16.5-month complete project analysis capabilities, 8.5/10 portfolio health scoring, and 75% forecast confidence for strategic planning and resource allocation

• Implemented resource optimization strategies achieving documented time savings across multiple projects, freed equivalent staff for high-value tasks, and expanded capabilities through systematic automation deployment

My production toolkit includes comprehensive experience with project management systems, budget forecasting with AI enhancement, multi-platform development coordination, automation frameworks deployment, and regulatory compliance management. I excel in fast-paced environments where strategic thinking, cross-functional coordination, and delivery excellence drive results.

I am excited about the opportunity to apply my production management expertise to casino game development, where precision, compliance, and player experience are paramount. My systematic approach to project coordination combined with proven ability to deliver complex gaming products positions me to immediately contribute to Light & Wonder's success.
