Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Quality Manager position on the Overwatch team at Blizzard Entertainment. As QA Lead for Global AI and Automation Strategy at Sony Interactive Entertainment, I have delivered end-to-end QA management for live service games, establishing testing standards, managing globally distributed teams across US, UK, and Japan studios, and collaborating with senior leadership to drive quality across every development milestone. I am ready to bring that same rigor and passion to help deliver the legendary "Blizzard polish" that players expect.

What I will bring to Overwatch:

• Advanced automation leadership with proven 179.55% efficiency improvements through FORGE framework implementation, Pathfinder integration for no-code automation, and systematic CI/CD pipeline development that I've deployed across multiple AAA titles

• Data-driven QA strategy using AI-enhanced analysis tools like Claude to identify risk patterns, predict defect trends, and optimize resource allocation - delivering 63.64% efficiency gains for critical projects while maintaining quality standards

• Parallel execution mastery running testing on 5 kits simultaneously, saving 37.5 minutes per test cycle and achieving 33.48% coverage expansion that enables deeper testing of critical features and enhanced edge case validation

• Global team scaling expertise having grown automation adoption from 7 to 47+ users across international studios, establishing standardized processes and cross-regional knowledge sharing frameworks

• Cross-functional bridge excellence connecting Test Services and Engineering across time zones, implementing automated Slack bridges for bug tracking, comprehensive Jira databases, and Python-AI administrative efficiency tools

Recent achievements at Sony Interactive Entertainment:

• Led Global AI and Automation Strategy initiatives managing quality across products with millions of active users, implementing systematic KPI tracking and centralized database storage for revolutionary AI-powered automation analysis

• Built comprehensive automation frameworks including FORGE (advanced), Pathfinder (beginner-friendly), and Visual Studio/DART (experienced) environments standardized across all global studios

• Established AI-ready data infrastructure enabling predictive automation analytics, intelligent maintenance scheduling, and dynamic ROI optimization that creates competitive advantage through comprehensive automation metrics

• Developed executive reporting dashboards providing real-time visibility into build health, automation ROI, and global quality metrics across multiple international game titles

• Implemented parallel execution strategies achieving measurable time optimization, resource optimization through freed equivalent testers, and expanded coverage capabilities through systematic automation

My technical expertise includes FORGE framework, Pathfinder automation, Python scripting with AI integration, comprehensive Jira-to-TestRail automation, Git workflows, advanced CI/CD systems, and proven experience across PC, console, and mobile platforms. I thrive in collaborative, iteration-focused environments where data-driven problem-solving and cross-functional teamwork drive excellence.

I understand what it takes to deliver games at Blizzard's caliber with systematic quality processes that scale globally. My proven track record of 33.48% efficiency increases combined with AI-enhanced analysis capabilities positions me to immediately contribute to Overwatch's continued success.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to contribute to Overwatch's continued success and help the team deliver epic entertainment experiences with the quality excellence Blizzard is known for.

Sincerely,
Kenneth Davis
